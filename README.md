## Overview üëì

A **Single Page (SPA)**, profile site created for one of my sporting idols, Roger Federer, to experiment with a few concepts, including **horizontal scrolling** and the **Robin-Dela Hover Effect**. This a Front-End Web application built using **ReactJS**, **SCSS** , **HTML5** and **various other libraries**.

Due to the **requirements of this project**, this has been designed for a **typical desktop/laptop viewing window only**. Mobile responsiveness is a potential feature to be added in the future.

## Process üìù
- I started by deciding which **famous person** to do a website on, having followed **Tennis from an early age**, I was curious what **Roger Federer's existing site** looked like and after some research, felt that I could **expand on the UX** of the existing site whilst **experimenting** with some **ideas** that I had.

- Next, as part of my **research**, I looked at some **example portfolio sites** to see what **libraries** and **frameworks** could be implemented on my site
- I **planned** and **wrote** out the **main features** that I wanted to include on my portfolio (i.e. a **Horizontal Scrolling Effect**, **Robin-Dela Hover Effect** for photos, **video players**)
